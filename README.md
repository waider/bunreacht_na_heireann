# bunreacht

Bunreacht na hEireann, better known as the Constitution of Ireland.

This is a little project to submit the English text to version control, mainly for personal entertainment value. The Irish text takes precedence in the case of any disagreements, but I've not included it here. The Second Amendment included edits intended to bring the two in line, and subsequent amendments have (to the best of my knowledge) taken care to not to reintroduce drift.
